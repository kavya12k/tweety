      <h1>WHAT IS TWEETY?</h1>
    <p> Tweety is a sentiment analysis model used to determine whether an inputted text has positive or negative connotations. It's mainly geered towards tweets from Twitter, but other text can be inputted.</p>

    <div class = "importance">
    
  <h1>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h1>
    <p> In a world of increasing anonymity online, malicious posts and hate tweets have been on a sharp rise. To protect the integrity of social platforms, Tweety aids in identifying whether a piece of text is negative or positive. While it can be used on its own, other companies, especially startups, can adapt this model if they're creating a social platform. </p>
      
      
    </div>


    <div class = "works">
     <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
    <p> Tweety uses AI to extract sentiment from statements. It is powered by the open source RoBERTa transformer from Hugging Face, which was trained off of approximately 60 million tweets. This transformer classifies tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. It uses Flask to tie together the JavaScript and API calls in python.</p>
